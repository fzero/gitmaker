gitmaker - creates a git repository on a ssh host and clones it locally.

Usage:
$ gitmaker <ssh host> <repo>

Where:
- <ssh host> is the remote ssh host in the user@host format.
  If you need to supply additional parameters (e.g. port), 
  enclose them all in quotes.
- <repo> is the repository to be created.

NOTE: It's STRONGLY recommended that you setup key-based SSH login to 
      use git over SSH - unless you like to type your password a lot!
